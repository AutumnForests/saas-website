          <h1>What is Squire?</h1>

          <p id="what-is-squire" class="whotext micro max-length push">The first concept for Squire was planned by CEO Catt Fenner, in the dorms of Edmonton University, after she found herself struggling to keep up to date on all of her social media accounts. “I was on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram etc, etc, all for the same purposes.” Said Fenner, “But while I would post an event advertisment on Twitter, I also wanted to share images of it on Instagram and information on Facebook. It was a lot to keep track of and I often forgot to post on every page needed, often leaving some friends and followers out of the loop.” That’s when Catt began to pen up solutions, ways for her to be able to post on all of her social media, all at the exact same push of a button, so she wouldn’t forget to do so seperatly. Thus, Squire was born.</p>

          <p id="beginning-squire" class="whotext micro max-length">While, at first, only a scribble of notes in an old sketchpad, Squire was in no way a small project on Catt Fenner’s mind. In 2015, she began to pitch the idea to friends and classmates, all of whom began working on larger concept and solutions to help get Squire onto the computer screen. Friends and classmates such as Mark Tugg and Winny Hash, now heads of Squires Design and Development divisions respectivly, provided the first layouts and blocks of code for Squire, turning those notes into blocks and numbers.</p>

          <p id="continuing-squire" class="whotext micro max-length">By 2016, Squire was ready to hit the interweb, but one vital key was still missing: support from the very platforms Squire wished to aid. With a reliable communications team and the motivation to make Squire’s voice heard, contacts with world-wide used social media sites such as Facebook, Tumblr and Twitter gave the go ahead and support needed to have Squire preform to its fullest on their platforms. By mid-2017, eight different social platforms had joined Squires side in making power-posting the best and most inclusive it could be. And with the arrival of 2018, Squire was ready to be fully launched to the public.</p>
